# Automated-Hate-Speech-Detection

Recent years, due to the collective reflection on cyberbullying and platform responsibility, there are ample research and funding into this field and thus make hate speech detection a very dynamic area. The biggest motivation of this project is to understand the mechanism behind automated hate speech detection by building a detector oneself. With a growing number of more accurate solutions and more precise labels, it is also meaningful to compare some of the existing models and understand the state-of-art. 

As a beginner in natural language processing without much coding experience, the point of this project is **to understand the mechanism** and some mainstream methods in hate speech automatic detection.

## This repo is created for the team project of the course Natural Language Processing @Hertie School. It is organized as the following:

* folder "Dataset" collects labbeled dataset by Davidson et al. Source link: https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language/tree/master/data

* folder "Codes" contains baseline model and the LSTM classifier, both edited in Colab environemt. As part of the course requirement, two seperate code documentation are uploaded in this section. 

* folder "Literature Review" includes all the downloaded journal article references used in this project

* folder "Reports & Feedbacks" hosts the final versions of the project proposal, midterm report, poster and the final report, as well as feedbacks from the course instructors.
