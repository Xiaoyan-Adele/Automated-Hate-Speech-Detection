# Automated-Hate-Speech-Detection

Recent years, due to the collective reflection on cyberbullying and platform responsibility, there are ample research and funding into this field and thus make hate speech detection a very dynamic area. The biggest motivation of this project is to understand the mechanism behind automated hate speech detection by building a detector oneself. With a growing number of more accurate solutions and more precise labels, it is also meaningful to compare some of the existing models and understand the state-of-art. 

Though the course syllabus demands this project to be completed with a team, the physical isolation of the author in Wuhan due to Covid19 outbreak make it a solo project

## This repo functions as a dairy of the author's learning process:
* folder "Dataset" collects labbeled dataset from the open web

* folder "Codes" contains baseline model and selected model of comparison. Meanwhile, as part of the course requirement, a seperate description of the code book will also be uploaded in this section. 

* folder "Literature Review" includes all references used in this project

* folder "Reports & Feedbacks" combines both final versions of the project proposal, midterm report, and the final report, as well as feedbacks from the course instructors. 


As a beginner in natural language processing without much coding experience, the point of this project is to understand the mechanism and some mainstream methods in hate speech automatic detection.
